# MINI-PROJECT-SERIES

Welcome to my **Mini Project Series**! 🚀  
I’m building one small project every day to sharpen my coding, data science, and machine learning skills.

Each day folder contains:
- A **Jupyter/Colab notebook** with code  
- Datasets (if applicable)  


# Day 1 – House Price Prediction  

# Day 2 - Spam Message Classifier

# Day 3 - Password Security Checker


## 🎯 What's Next

I’ll continue adding **one mini project per day**, tackling different topics like classification, clustering, NLP, etc.

If you want to collaborate, suggest a project, or give feedback — just reach out!
