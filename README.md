# MINI-PROJECT-SERIES

Welcome to my **Mini Project Series**! 🚀  
I’m building one small project every day to sharpen my coding, data science, and machine learning skills.

-----

Each day folder contains:
- A **Jupyter/Colab notebook** with code  
- Datasets (if applicable)  


## 🧠 Day 1 – House Price Prediction

**Tech Stack:**  
Python | Google Colab | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-Learn

**What I did:**  
- Loaded sample data  
- Trained a **Linear Regression** model  
- Predicted house prices  
- Visualized results  


# Day 2 - Spam Message Classifier

**Mini Project Series by K. Gayatri**  

---

## 🔹 Objective
Build a Machine Learning model to classify **SMS messages** as **Spam or Not Spam**.

---

## 🔹 Tech Stack
- Python  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-Learn  
- TF-IDF Vectorizer  
- Multinomial Naive Bayes  

---

## 🔹 Files in this folder
- `spam_message_classifier.py` → Python script with full implementation  
- `spam.csv` → Sample dataset of SMS messages  

---

## 🔹 Steps in the Project
1. Load and preprocess dataset  
2. Convert text messages to numerical features using TF-IDF  
3. Train Naive Bayes classifier  
4. Evaluate model using Accuracy, Classification Report, and Confusion Matrix  
5. Test model on custom messages  
6. Optional: Save trained model as `.pkl`  

---

## 🔹 Example Predictions
| Message | Prediction |
|---------|------------|
| "Congratulations! You won a free lottery, claim now!!!" | ⚠️ Spam |
| "Hey, are we still meeting for lunch today?" | ✅ Not Spam |
| "URGENT! Your account has been suspended, verify now" | ⚠️ Spam |
| "Can you send me the notes from yesterday?" | ✅ Not Spam |

---

## 🔹 Learning Outcomes
- Understand text preprocessing for NLP  
- Implement TF-IDF for feature extraction  
- Build and evaluate Naive Bayes classifier  
- Present clear results for practical use  

---

## 🔹 Next Steps
- Improve accuracy using additional preprocessing (stopwords removal, stemming)  
- Explore other classifiers like Logistic Regression or SVM  
- Extend to real-world large datasets  


## 🎯 What's Next

I’ll continue adding **one mini project per day**, tackling different topics like classification, clustering, NLP, etc.
